# Object Tracking robitic arm.
Embedded Systems (8234).

A project I did for one of my classes in early 2018. 
It consists of a camera mounted on a mini robitoc arm controlled by an arduino uno. 
The arduino receives commands serailly in real time from a python scirpt running a selection of object classification and detection frameworks.
