# Object Tracing robitic arm.
Embedded Systems (8234).

A project I did for one of my class in early 2018. 
It consists of a camera mounted on a mini robitoc arm controlled by an arduino uno. 
The arduino receives commands serailly in real time from a python scirpt running a selection og object classification and detection frameworks. 

Feel Free fork it and play around with it but pleasde don't use it as your assignment.
